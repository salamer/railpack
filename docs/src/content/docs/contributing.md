Railpack is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack).
This project is still early with large architecture changes still being made,
but significant PRs are welcome. See the [contributing
guide](https://github.com/salamer/railpack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for
more details.

Check out [this guide](/guides/developing-locally) for how to set things up
locally.
