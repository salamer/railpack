import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The easiest way to use Railpack is to deploy on a platform like Railway. Builds
should work out of the box with minimal configuration. From there, you can see
the docs for each language that Railpack supports.

- [Python](languages/python)
- [Go](languages/golang)
- [PHP](languages/php)
- [HTML](languages/staticfile)
- [Java](languages/java)
- [Deno](languages/deno)

If you want to run Railpack locally, follow the steps below. Follow [this
guide](/guides/running-railpack-in-production) if you want to run Railpack on a
platform in production.

## Installation

Install Railpack from GH releases ([or install with another
method](/installation))

```sh
curl -sSL https://railpack.com/install.sh | sh
```

Confirm that Railpack is installed correctly:

```sh
railpack --help
```

## Building

Before building, you need to have a BuildKit instance running and available
through the `BUILDKIT_HOST` environment variable. The easiest way to do this is
to run a BuildKit instance as a container:

```bash
mise run setup
```

Now you can build your image using Railpack:

```sh
railpack build ./path/to/project
```

_(there are many examples in the [Railpack
repo](https://github.com/salamer/railpack/tree/main/examples) that you can
test with)_
