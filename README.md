Railpack is a tool for building images from source code with minimal
configuration. It is the successor to [Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com) and
incorporates many of the learnings from running Nixpacks in production at
[Railway](https://railway.com) for several years.

## Documentation

Railpack is an early work in progress and constantly evolving. Documentation for
both operators and users is available at [railpack.com](https://railpack.com).

## Contributing

Railpack is open source and open to contributions. Keep in mind that the project
is early and core architectural changes are still being made.
